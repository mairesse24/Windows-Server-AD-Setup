# Windows-Server-AD-Setup
Building an Active Directory Domain Controller and client in Microsoft Azure 

# Overview
This project demonstrates how I created and configured a small Active Directory (AD) environment using Microsoft Azure.
The lab includes setting up a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller and a Windows 10 client machine connected to the same virtual network.

# Objectives
<ul>
  <li>Create a resource group, virtual network, and subnet in Azure</li>
  <li>Deploy two virtual machines: <strong>DC-1</strong> (Windows Server 2022) and <strong>Client-1</strong> (Windows 10)</li>
  <li>Install and configure <strong>Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)</strong></li>
  <li>Promote the server to a <strong>Domain Controller</strong> and create a domain (<em>mydomain.com</em>)</li>
  <li>Create <strong>Organizational Units (OUs)</strong> and add <strong>user accounts</strong> and <strong>admin accounts</strong></li>
  <li>Join Client-1 to the domain</li>
  <li>Configure <strong>Remote Desktop</strong> access for domain users</li>
  <li>Automate user creation with <strong>PowerShell</strong></li>
</ul>

# Learning Outcomes
<ul>
  <li>Learned how to deploy and manage virtual machines in Azure</li>
  <li>Gained hands-on experience with domain setup and user management</li>
  <li>Practiced joining devices to a domain and managing permissions</li>
  <li>Used PowerShell scripting to automate account creation</li>
  <li>Strengthened understanding of network administration and access control</li>
