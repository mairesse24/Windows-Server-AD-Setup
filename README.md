# Windows-Server-AD-Setup
Hands-on lab building an Active Directory Domain Controller and client in Microsoft Azure.

# Overview
This project demonstrates how I created and configured a small Active Directory (AD) environment using Microsoft Azure.
The lab includes setting up a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller and a Windows 10 client machine connected to the same virtual network.

# Objectives
Create a resource group, virtual network, and subnet in Azure
Deploy two virtual machines: DC-1 (Windows Server 2022) and Client-1 (Windows 10)
Install and configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
Promote the server to a Domain Controller and create a domain (mydomain.com)
Create Organizational Units (OUs) and add user accounts and admin accounts
Join Client-1 to the domain
Configure Remote Desktop access for domain users
Automate user creation with PowerShell

# Learning Outcomes
Learned how to deploy and manage virtual machines in Azure
Gained hands-on experience with domain setup and user management
Practiced joining devices to a domain and managing permissions
Used PowerShell scripting to automate account creation
Strengthened understanding of network administration and access control
